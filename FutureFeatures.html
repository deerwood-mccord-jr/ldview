<H3>Future features</H3>
Here is my current to-do list (in no particular order):
<OL>
<LI>Add detection of invalid command line arguments.</LI>
<!--<LI>Add an option to use smooth circular points at the endpoints of lines
when the line thickness is set above 1.</LI> This didn't work -TC -->
<LI>Fix Landscape printing.</LI>
<LI>Add an <I>Options</I> submenu under the <I>View</I> menu to switch many of
the instant-update preferences on and off (with keyboard shortcuts for all of
them).  (For instance, lighting enable, wireframe enable, etc.)</LI>
<LI>Add support for [Views] section of ldraw.ini.</LI>
<LI>Smooth polygon outline for polygon antialiasing of pattern polygons
(polygons that aren't in the default color).</LI>
<LI>Add support for 1-8sphc.dat primitive substitution.</LI>
<LI>Add support for stereo pair printing (when stereo mode is enabled).</LI>
<LI>Add ability to set render DPI when printing.  (Currently always uses printer
DPI).</LI>
<LI>Improve transparent polygon sorting.</LI>
<LI>Add other model motions to the screensaver.</LI>
</OL>
Here are some more to-do items which I may or may not work on (also in no
particular order):
<OL>
<LI>Improve preset viewing angles.  (Toolbar?)</LI>
<LI>Add true orthogonal support.</LI>
<LI>Add a way for the user to adjust the various lighting parameters (ambient,
diffuse, specular).</LI>
<LI>Add more stud options, such as drawing them as just a line as MLCad allows,
or even perhaps as just a texture map (although I can't imagine a texture map
that would look good from multiple viewing angles).  With modern 3D
accelerators, a texture map would probably be faster than even the simplified
stud geometry.</LI>
<LI>Add environment mapping (definitely optional).  Would include the ability
to specify an environment map.</LI>
<LI>If I get environment mapping working, add support for reflective colors
such as chrome and gold.</LI>
<LI>Radar in fly-through mode.</LI>
<LI>Look at model command.</LI>
</OL>
